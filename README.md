**1. Explain unit testing and its benefits ?

Ans
- Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation, typically at the function or method level. The main goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.

Key aspects and benefits of unit testing:

- _Isolation:_ Unit tests are designed to be independent of other parts of the system. This isolation ensures that failures in one unit do not cascade into failures in other units, making it easier to pinpoint and fix bugs.
- _Early_ _Detection_ _of_ _Defects:_ Unit tests are typically written before the code is implemented or at least as soon as possible after implementation. By identifying defects early in the development process, unit testing helps reduce the cost and effort of fixing bugs later in the development cycle.
- _Improved_ _Code_ _Quality:_ Writing unit tests often leads to better-designed code. When developers write tests for their code, they tend to structure their code in a more modular and maintainable way, making it easier to understand and modify.
- _Documentation:_ Unit tests serve as a form of documentation for the codebase. By reading the unit tests, developers can quickly understand how a particular unit of code is supposed to behave, which can be especially helpful when working on large or complex systems.
- _Regression_ _Testing:_ Unit tests provide a safety net for making changes to the codebase. When new features are added or existing features are modified, running the unit tests helps ensure that the changes have not introduced unintended side effects or regressions.
- _Facilitates_ _Refactoring:_ Unit tests make it easier to refactor code with confidence. By having a suite of tests in place, developers can make changes to the codebase knowing that if they accidentally break something, the tests will catch it.
- _Supports_ _Continuous_ _Integration/Continuous_ _Deployment_ _(CI/CD):_ Unit tests are a crucial component of a CI/CD pipeline. They can be automated to run whenever code changes are made, providing rapid feedback to developers and helping to maintain the stability of the codebase.
